| Sexual decision making and self-discipline | % students intoxicated   | 
There are 8 states in which sex ed is mandated but in which fewer than 70% of schools provide teachers strategies for teaching sex ed. In these states, teachers have a large amount of discretion. (However, it is unclear if this disparity between mandate and policy has an effect on student health. All of these 8 states have an STD index of 0.45 or lower, scoring better than about half of all states. In fact, one of the states, Vermont, has the lowest STD index of any state. By another metric, births per 1,000 girls, this result is less definitive: the states fall over a wide range, from 27.2 (Kentucky) to 8.8 (Vermont).) |"
