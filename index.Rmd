### Header 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-library-Fauci/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)


(a) change “summary(cars)” to “mosaic::favstats(~speed, data = cars)”; and (b) add “echo=FALSE” as a code chunk option to suppress the printing of the code in the output file.  That is, the r code chunk should be “```{r cars, echo=FALSE}”.  Knit the file.  Commit and push BOTH index.Rmd and index.html to GitHub.  Check your group’s website, and see that the relevant text has been updated.
